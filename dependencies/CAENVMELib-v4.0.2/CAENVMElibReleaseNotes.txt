  What's New in Rel. 4.0.2
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Allowing CAENVME_IRQCheck even if not connected with a CONET master
      supporting IRQ (reqression introduced in 4.0.0).
   - Support for first public CAEN A5818 driver.

  What's New in Rel. 4.0.1
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Fix connection to A2818 on Windows (regression introduced in 4.0.0).
   - Fix connection to internal registers of A3818 on Windows (regression
      introduced in 4.0.0).
   - Fix connection to A2719 using A2818 on Windows (regression introduced in
      3.2.0).
   - Fix connection to A2719 using A3818, A4818 and A5818 on modern hardware.
   - Add runtime check to avoid connection to A2719 on daisy chain, i.e. with
      conet node other than zero.
   - Fix CAENVME_BoardFWRelease for A5818.

  What's New in Rel. 4.0.0
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Support for A5818.
   - Fix an error that report invalid cvAlreadyOpenError when using more than
      one PCI/PCIe CONET adapters (A2818, A3818 and A5818).
   - Add const qualifier to data width pointer parameter of CAENVME_MultiRead
      and CAENVME_MultiWrite.
   - When using a V4718, some returned error values had an offset of -4.
   - Fix possible undefined behavior when using CAENVME_WriteCycle with data
      width smaller than 32.
   - Fix possible undefined behavior when using CAENVME_Init2 on cvETH_V4718.
   - On Linux, library is now compiled with -O2 (was -O0).
   - Improved consistency of interprocess serialization to access a device.
   - On Linux, libusb-1.0 is initialized only when we connect to a A4818. This
      fixes a regression introduced on version 3.4.2.
   - On Windows, the library succesfully connected to a random A4818 plugged
      in a computer (if any) even if the PID passed to CAENVME_Init2 was not
      valid. This fixes a regression introduced on version 3.4.2.
   - Fix library upgrade on V4718 OpenARM.
   - Fix CAENVME_DriverRelease that was failing in some cases.
   - Fix possible undefined behavior when using functions with invalid handle
      as argument: now cvInvalidParam is returned in that cases.
   - Fix CAENVME_WriteFlashPage/CAENVME_ReadFlashPage when using A4818 or
      V3718.
   - On Windows, fix a possible connection issue when using more than one
      A4818.
   - In some cases, CAENVME_Init2 could return success also in case of CONET
      slave missing.
   - Support for DNS resolution when connecting to V4718 via Ethernet.
   - Fix use of A2818 on Windows when using unintialized devices on the
      CONET daisy chain.
   - CAENVME_IRQDisable mask parameter was ignored: now the function not
      only disables all the interrupts from the link, but also disables bits
      from the enabled mask.
   - Fix possible undefined behavior on CAENVME_RMWCycle: the function was
      always dereferencing input data as uin32_t even if DW was smaller. Now
      the dereferenced size is that specified by DW.
   - CAENVME_MultiWrite return cvSuccess even if some cycles have failed,
      for consistency with CAENVME_MultiRead. Cycle results must be checked
      on the output error codes vector.
   - Fix access to A2719 via A4818.
   - Windows setup now automatically uninstalls an already installed version
      of this library, if its version is >= 3.3.6.
   - Fix return value in case of error when using CAENVME_SetInputConf,
      CAENVME_GetInputConf, CAENVME_SetOutputRegister,
      CAENVME_ClearOutputRegister and CAENVME_PulseOutputRegister on some
      legacy hardware.
   - _CAENVME_OpticalLinkSlaveReset is now marked as deprecated.
   - Support for Visual Studio 2008 dropped (Microsoft extended support
      ended on April 2018).

  What's New in Rel. 3.4.4
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Fix CAENVME_MultiRead and CAENVME_MultiWrite when using V4718 with cvD16,
      cvD16swapped and cvD8, broken since 3.3.7.

  What's New in Rel. 3.4.3
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Linux only: Fix regression introduced on version 3.4.2 that broke the
      usage of A2818 and A3818.

  What's New in Rel. 3.4.2
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Linux only: improved readout rate when using A4818.
   - Linux only: now it is possible to open more than one A4818 on the same
      process.
   - Linux only: fix some inconsistent error codes (i.e. not related to
      CVErrorCodes) returning from API functions.
   - Linux only: fix race condition happening when opening at least twice
      the same resource (for example two devices in daisy chain on the same
      optical link), closing one connection and opening again that resource:
      in that case the new connection did not use the same mutex of the
      existing previous connections.
   - Fix possible race conditions of CAENVME_Init/CAENVME_Init2 (when using
      A4818 only), CAENVME_BoardFWRelease, CAENVME_DriverRelease,
      CAENVME_DeviceReset and _CAENVME_OpticalLinkSlaveReset.
   - Fix race conditions when using cvUSB_A4818_LOCAL and cvUSB_A4818 at the
      same time.
   - Other minor fixes.

  What's New in Rel. 3.4.1
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Fix Linux installer on distributions where /usr/lib is not in the
      default dynamic linker search path.
   - Linux installers now fail if libusb-1.0 is not present in the system.
   - Fix CAENVME_EraseFlashPage when using specific hardware.

  What's New in Rel. 3.4.0
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   - Fix bug added on version 3.2.0, which introduced a regression by
      swapping the second and third argument of CAENVME_Init for all board
      types except for cvV1718, cvUSB_V3718 and cvUSB_V3718_LOCAL. All
      users that are upgrading from 3.2.0 or newer version, and that are
      not using one of these board types, must swap the second and third
      arguments of CAENVME_Init or, preferably, use CAENVME_Init2. Users
      of CAENComm library that also upgraded that library to CAENComm 1.4.1
      did not notice any difference because internally the CAENComm started
      using the swapped arguments. With this change, the CAENVME Library is
      backward compatible with versions before 3.2.0. We strongly recommend
      users of CAENComm to upgrade to the latest version, 1.6.0, released
      contextually with this release. Also, all new users should use
      CAENVME_Init2 instead of CAENVME_Init, that is kept only for legacy
      support. Note also that the interface of CAENVME_Init2, that has been
      introduced on version 3.3.0, has not been modified.
   - Add const to void* argument of CAENVME_Init2.
   - CAENVME_Init is now marked as deprecated.
   - Add support for A4818 and V4718 (via USB) with PID greater than SHRT_MAX
      (typically 32767). The connection to these devices is not supported on
      the now deprecated CAENVME_Init.
   - Add arm64 build on Linux package.
   - Fix CAENVME_BoardFWRelease. A partial fix released on 3.3.3 introduced
      some connection errors when using CAENComm.
   - Fix IRQ enable: it was working only when CONET number was identical to
      link number and only for number < 4.
   - Fix CAENVME_StartPulser and CAENVME_StopPulser when connecting to V3717
      either via USB or A4818, and to V4718 via A4818.
   - Fix ReadRegister and WriteRegister on cvUSB_A4818_LOCAL, that were
      always returning success also in case of failure.
   - Fix CAENVME_Init2 on cvUSB_V4718_LOCAL and cvUSB_V4718 that could fail
      to detect an already opened device in some rare cases.
